This is my second project of full stack development.
In this project, it shows the webpage with viewport and
it also have responsive nature.
# Types of files and links used:
I have used two file one is the HTML file and other is CSS file.
I used links of bootstrap and javascript in this project which are
placed in the head tag of the html file.
# HTML file:
In this file, I used links of bootstrap, javascript and css file in the
head tag.
In the body tag, I used a main div, and for grid, I used r div for rows,
c div for columns and content div.
In the main tag, all these tags are contained and given a heading to the
webpage and about button and it connects to the wikipedia.
In the content div, I have given img tag, a tag, paragraph tag which
are included in c div.
I used four div tag in the r div for placing four images in a single grid.
After r div, I used another div tag for the content1 for placing another
image and a website is linked to that image.
I used a footer tag to give the developer name and linked to the
github website.
And I have ended the main tag, body tag.
# CSS file:
In this file, I have given styling to the body tag, main tag, r tag and
c tag, img tag to make page look beautiful.
I have used a media query to make breakpoints at two different points.
This is externally linked to HTML file.
